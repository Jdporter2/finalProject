Objective:
This program will allow 1-2 players play blackjack together.
Import random function
I will start by asking how many players are playing.
Create 2 if functions for each number of players
Give each player a random number from 1-11, and display a random number that the dealer has
Ask each player if they want to hit or stand
if the player hits, they get a new random number, and the question is asked again
if the player chooses to stand, their turn is over

Psedocode:
#set keepPlaying to True
#While keepPlaying is True:
    #import random function
    #Set all players numbers to 0
    #Ask player to input how many players are playing(1-2)
    #Create an if statement for the amount of players
        #then set the variable numPlayers = onePlayers, twoPlayers, etc.
    #Create six if statements for each numPlayers value
        #For each if statement, give the player a number and prompt the player to either input hit or stand
